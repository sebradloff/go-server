## GoCD in a box

This project contains a dockerized GoCD server, GoCD agent, and a git-daemon to server your pipeline as code setup.

The purpose of this project is to be able to spin up a local instance of your CI/CD pipeline to test your changes locally before pushing to your "production" CI/CD server.

The docker-compose command takes an environment variable name "PIPELINE_CODE". This variable specifies the location of your pipeline as code repository which is volume mounted into the git-daemon container.

To run this project with one server and one agent you should run the following:

`$ PIPELINE_CODE="PATH_TO_PIPELINE_CODE" docker-compose up`

If you'd like to scale the number of Go agents you can run the docker-compose scale command:

`$ PIPELINE_CODE="PATH_TO_PIPELINE_CODE" docker-compose up -d && docker-compose scale go-agent=3`

Here we scale the number of Go agents to 3 but you can replace that number for however many agents you'd like.
